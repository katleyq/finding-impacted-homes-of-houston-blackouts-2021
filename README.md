In February of 2021, the state of Texas was hit with multiple severe winter storms that impacted the power grid and caused widespread blackouts throughout the state. In this project, I will be looking at Houston, Texas specifically. I am using satellite data to anlayze the spatial extent of the blackouts.

For this project, I will be:
- estimating the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms
- investigating if socioeconomic factors are predictors of communities recovery from a power outage
